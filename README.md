<h1>Digital Business Card</h1>
<img SRC="preview.png">
<h2>Summary:</h2>
An app I am creating that will allow you to easily share your contact information and store others'
info with a single link or qr code.
<h2>Current stage:</h2>
I am currently in the process of designing the digital card and making it so that it is
responsive to most popular screen sizes.
<h2>Goal:</h2>
My goal is have a landing page where users input their
name, job title, up to 6 links, and 4-16 skill icons.
Once the information is input, a digital business card and qr code are generated.
People won't need an account to see other people's cards when they scan the code,
but in order to save cards, the app will be needed.
